Split it up by person, each person shows their contribution (ex: citation generator) and code that shows one/two of the collegeboard requirements (ex: lists code block, shows how your code uses lists)
Follow explanation of requirement in your code with a demo of ur tool + how it uses that collegeboard requirement
And then how you debugged, used postman, your process

Show code blocks for ALL requirements (keep this concise) but you only TALK about one, show demo for like one or talk about how your requirements come together to make ur tool
